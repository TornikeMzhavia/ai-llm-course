            "Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Sunlight enters the atmosphere**: When sunlight from the sun enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
            "2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
            "3. **Blue light is dispersed**: The blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, while the red light continues to travel in a straight line, reaching our eyes from a more direct path.\n",
            "4. **Our eyes perceive the color**: When we look at the sky, our eyes see the scattered blue light as the dominant color, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. It's responsible for many of the beautiful colors we see in nature, such as sunsets and clouds.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other factors can influence the color of the sky, like:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dust and pollution**: Tiny particles in the atmosphere can scatter light and change its appearance.\n",
            "* **Clouds and water vapor**: Clouds and water vapor can absorb or scatter light, affecting the color of the sky.\n",
            "* **Time of day and angle of viewing**: The time of day and the angle at which we view the sky can also affect its apparent color.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, under most conditions, the blue sky is due to Rayleigh scattering, which is why it appears blue during the daytime when the sun is overhead.\n"

            "The ocean is salty due to a combination of geological and biological processes that have been occurring over millions of years. Here are some reasons why:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Weathering of rocks**: When rainwater or seawater comes into contact with rocks on land, it can dissolve minerals such as sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). These minerals then become part of the ocean's water chemistry.\n",
            "2. **Erosion of salt deposits**: As rivers flow towards the sea, they carry dissolved salts with them. When these rivers meet the ocean, the salts are deposited onto the seafloor or washed out to sea.\n",
            "3. **Evaporation**: As seawater evaporates, it leaves behind its salts and minerals. This process is more pronounced in areas where evaporation rates are high, such as in arid regions or during droughts.\n",
            "4. **Biological processes**: Many marine organisms, like plankton and algae, absorb salts through their cells. When these organisms die and sink to the seafloor, they can be broken down by microorganisms that release more salt into the water.\n",
            "5. **Global circulation of water**: The ocean's water circulates around the globe through various currents, which helps distribute salts from one region to another.\n",
            "\n",
            "The process of salt accumulation in the ocean has been occurring for so long that it has become a self-sustaining system. Today, the average salinity of seawater is about 3.5% (35 grams of dissolved salts per kilogram of water), which is roughly twice as salty as freshwater.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's worth noting that the concentration of salt in seawater varies depending on factors like location, depth, and temperature. For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Seawater in tropical regions tends to be less saline than seawater in temperate or polar regions.\n",
            "* Deeper waters tend to have higher salinity levels due to lower evaporation rates.\n",
            "* The salinity of seawater can also be affected by human activities like pollution, coastal development, and climate change.\n",
            "\n",
